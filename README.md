<h1>Aadhar card information extraction with Named Entity Recognition or Object Detection</h1>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Make a system that takes an Aadhar Card as an input and returns all the info present in the Aadhar card like Aadhar Number, Name, Address, DoB, gender etc.</p>
<h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
<p>Data Acquisition for this project was the biggest hurdle as it's not easy to get people's Aadhar card. </p>
<p>So what I did went on google and searched for Aadhar card original Images and wallah. I was able to get 40 original Aadhar cards through google image search. As finding images were very time-consuming, I just sampled 40 pictures and finished the data acquisition. </p>
<h2>Main Goal of this Project</h2>
<p>This project's main goal was to make a kind of baseline system (model) that works okayish and can be later tuned with more data and more training. </p>
<h2>Different Approach</h2>
<p>There are two possible approaches to which we can choose. Either extract information by building a NER model or go with the Object detection approach. I'll give a summary of both methods.</p>
